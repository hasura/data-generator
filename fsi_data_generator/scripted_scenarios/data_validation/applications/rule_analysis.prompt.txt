Analyze the data validation rules by:

First, locate and extract the complete validation definition from the validation_run table

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
* Always present the requested artifact at the end of each step
* Always verify each step before proceeding to the next step
* Never combine steps
* Always use the data from the previous step in the next step if possible

Step 1. For each validation run, identify its schema rule, for each unique schema rule, extract the field-level rule, and then:

* Examine the field-level rule descriptions and titles
* Look for explicit rule numbering or labels
* Find conditional logic (if/then statements)
* Analyze required field specifications
* Review allowed values and matching requirements
* Classify field-level rules by data quality dimension (Completeness, Accuracy, Consistency, Validity, Timeliness, Uniqueness, Integrity)

Output - A table artifact.
IMPORTANT: Present this artifact before continuing to next Step

Step 2. For each identified rule:

* What is the core requirement?
* What are the conditions under which it applies?
* What exceptions are allowed?
* How is it enforced in the validation?
* Which data quality dimension(s) does it address?
* How does it measure/enforce that dimension?

Output - A table artifact.
IMPORTANT: Present this artifact before continuing to next Step

Step 3. Document dependencies between rules:

* Which rules reference other rules?
* Are there cascading requirements?
* Do conditions in one rule affect another?
* Do rules for different quality dimensions interact?
* Are there hierarchies of quality dimensions (e.g., completeness before accuracy)?

Step 4. Output - A table artifact.
IMPORTANT: Present this artifact before continuing to next Step

Validate your understanding by:

* Cross-referencing rules with validation errors
* Looking for patterns that confirm or challenge your interpretation
* Identifying any gaps or ambiguities in the rules
* Analyzing coverage of data quality dimensions
* Identifying any dimensions not addressed by current rules

Output - A table artifact.
IMPORTANT: Present this artifact before continuing to next Step

Step 5. Provide a structured analysis showing:

* The complete set of business rules
* Their conditions and exceptions
* How they interact with each other
* How they are enforced in the validation
* Coverage analysis by data quality dimension
* Recommendations for missing dimension coverage

Output - A markdown formatted artifact.
