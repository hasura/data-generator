The objective is to identify fiduciaries who are withdrawing funds from their
principals' accounts improperly.

GENERAL GUIDANCE:
 * Always display artifacts from each step before proceeding to the next.
 * Reuse artifacts from previous steps if possible.

Step 1.
Sample existing party relationship types from internal data,
consider the context (financial services) and legal definitions,
and classify each type as fiduciary or other.
Derive a definition of the relationship from external sources,
and provide your reasoning.
Store this as an artifact.

Step 2.
Using the previous classifications, list fiduciaries and their principals
where both parties have consumer bank accounts with an 'active' status.
Provide names, roles, account IDs, and total consumer banking transactions
count for all time.
Store this as an artifact.

Step 3.
I am concerned with fiduciary misconduct.
Using the previous analysis, look at all transactions for the previous 2 years.
Identify a DR from a principal account which is followed by a CR to a fiduciary
account within 0 to 14 days.
Positive/negative amounts do not represent credit/debit; instead,
they are indicated by a 'CR' or 'DR' attribute.
Consider similar amounts or aggregate amounts within a tolerance of 15%.
Store this as an artifact.

Step 4.
Based on bank or regulatory policy, identify actions that should be taken
for each of the transactions from the previous analysis, including:
- whether a SAR should be filed,
- the reasoning behind the SAR filing recommendation considering:
  - transaction threshold regulatory guidance,
  - progressively larger amounts indicating testing,
  - transaction description differences,
  - temporal restructuring that seem to be an attempt to obfuscate,
  - transaction layering.

Present the transactions as a table in a business-friendly format, including:
- names,
- account IDs,
- transaction descriptions,
- SAR recommendations,
- SAR reasons,
- a prioritized list of next steps.

Store this as an artifact.

Step 5.
Using the analysis from the previous step, filter by SAR filing recommendation as true,
group by fiduciary/principal, and draft a SAR filing.
Format the filing per FinCEN guidance.
Include FinCEN red flag categories but ONLY using evidence from the transactions
referenced in the SAR filing.
Store each file as a separate text artifact.
