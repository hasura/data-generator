Step 1. Sample party relationship types, consider the context (financial services) and legal definitions,
and classify each type as fiduciary or other, provide a definition of the relationship, and your reasoning.
Store this as an artifact.

Step 2. Using the previous classifications, list fiduciaries and their principals where both parties have
consumer bank accounts with an 'active' status. Provide names, role, account ids, and total transactions
count for all time. Store this as an artifact.

Step 3. I am concerned with fiduciary misconduct. Using the previous analysis,
look for patterns where a DR from a principal account is followed by a CR to a fiduciary account within 0 to 14 days.
Positive/negative amounts do not represent credit/debit, instead they are indicated by a 'CR' or 'DR' attribute.
Consider similar amounts or aggregate amounts within a tolerance of 15%. Store this as an artifact.

Step 4. Based on bank or regulatory policy, identify actions that should be taken for each of the transactions
from the previous analysis, including
- whether a SAR should be filed,
- the reasoning behind the SAR filing recommendation considering
     * transaction threshold regulatory guidance,
     * progressively larger amounts indicating testing,
     * transaction description differences,
     * temporal restructuring that seem to be an attempt to obfuscate
     * transaction layering.

Present the transactions as a table in a business friendly format,
including names, account ids, transaction descriptions, SAR recommendation, SAR reasons, and a prioritized list of next steps.
Store this as an artifact.

Step 5. Using the analysis from the previous step, filter by SAR filing recommendation as true,
group by fiduciary/principal, and draft a SAR filing.
Format the filing per FinCEN guidance.
Include FinCEN red flag categories but ONLY using evidence from the transactions referenced in the SAR filing.
Store each file as a separate text artifact.
