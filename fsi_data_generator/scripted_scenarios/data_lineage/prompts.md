# Strategic Questions for Key Stakeholders: Leveraging FDX Data Lineage & Provenance

This document provides strategic questions for different roles within an organization that provides FDX (Financial Data Exchange) services. These questions are designed to help each stakeholder extract maximum value from data lineage and provenance information.

## Data Quality Executive

### Data Quality Assessment
1. What are the most common field transformations being applied to account data from the FDX API?
2. Show me a complete lineage map for customer account balance fields from the FDX endpoint to our final data store.
3. Which account data fields undergo the most transformations, and what are those transformations?
4. Identify any inconsistent transformation patterns across similar FDX account records.
5. What percentage of our account data transformations modify sensitive customer information?

### Provenance Analysis
6. For account ID [X], compare the actual data provenance against our designed lineage - are there discrepancies?
7. What's the most common deviation between our intended data lineage and the actual provenance we're recording?
8. Show me instances where account data transformations took significantly longer than expected.
9. Identify any gaps in our provenance tracking where we're missing transformation details.
10. Generate a report of all account data transformations performed in the last month that weren't in our lineage design.

## Data Governance Executive

### Lineage Design Review
1. Compare our designed data lineage for account information against current FDX standards - are there any gaps?
2. Are all our sensitive account data fields following their designated lineage paths in practice?
3. What percentage of our FDX API calls have complete provenance records that match our lineage design?
4. Identify any transformations applied to PII fields that weren't in our approved lineage documentation.
5. Which servers are handling account data transformations outside their designated lineage paths?

### Governance and Compliance
6. Generate an audit report comparing intended lineage against actual provenance for regulatory fields.
7. Are there any FDX account data fields that don't have properly documented lineage?
8. Compare our transformation processes against our documented governance policies for account data.
9. Which transformations are applied to PII fields from the FDX /accounts endpoint, and are they compliant with our data protection policies?
10. Generate a complete audit trail for account ID [X], showing all API calls and transformations.

## Data Architect

### Architecture Analysis
1. Show me the complete end-to-end lineage map for how customer account balance data should flow through our systems.
2. What are the expected transformation rules for normalizing account owner information from the FDX format?
3. Identify potential bottlenecks or single points of failure in our designed account data lineage.
4. How do our field mappings for transforming FDX account data align with our enterprise data model?
5. Trace the complete journey of account owner information from the FDX endpoint through all transformations.

### Optimization Opportunities
6. Based on our provenance data, which account data transformations could be optimized or consolidated?
7. Are there redundant transformation steps in our actual data flows that aren't in our lineage design?
8. What's the average time for account data to flow through our entire lineage, and where are the delays?
9. Based on our provenance records, should we revise our lineage design to better match actual data flows?
10. Compare transformation performance across different servers handling our account data flows.

## Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)

### Customer Behavior and Patterns
1. Which account data fields are most frequently accessed through our API, and how might this inform our product marketing strategy?
2. Can we identify patterns in how our financial institution customers are transforming account data that might indicate new use cases or needs?
3. What's the typical journey of our most valuable data elements through customer systems, and how can we highlight this in our marketing?

### Product Usage Metrics
4. Which types of financial institutions are most actively using our FDX account data, based on API call frequency and transformation patterns?
5. Are there seasonal or cyclical patterns in how our FDX data is being consumed that should inform our marketing calendar?
6. What percentage of our customers are using our data in ways we didn't anticipate, suggesting potential new market opportunities?

### Competitive Differentiation
7. How do customers transform our raw account data compared to industry standards, and what does this tell us about our data quality or uniqueness?
8. Which specific data transformations add the most apparent value to our customers, based on frequency and complexity?
9. Are there fields in our FDX data that require extensive transformation by customers, suggesting opportunities for product enhancement?

### Customer Success Stories
10. Identify customers who have implemented the most sophisticated or efficient data lineage for our account data - they could be potential case studies.
11. What unique ways are innovative customers transforming our account data that we could highlight in marketing materials?

### Market Expansion Opportunities
12. Are there patterns in how newer fintech customers transform our data differently than traditional financial institutions?
13. Which account data elements undergo the most complex transformations, potentially indicating where we could offer value-added services?
14. Based on API usage patterns, which market segments appear to be underutilizing our FDX capabilities?

### Product Development Insights
15. What transformations are customers consistently applying to our data that we could incorporate into our core offering?
16. Are customers creating workarounds for limitations in our data structure that should inform our product roadmap?
