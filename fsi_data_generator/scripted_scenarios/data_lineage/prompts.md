# Strategic Questions for Key Stakeholders: Leveraging FDX Data Lineage & Provenance

This document provides strategic questions for different roles within an organization that provides FDX (Financial Data Exchange) services. These questions are designed to help each stakeholder extract maximum value from data lineage and provenance information, focusing primarily on current state with temporal analysis where beneficial.

## Data Quality Executive

### Current Data Quality Assessment

1. "What are the most common field transformations currently being applied to FDX account data before exposure through our API?"
2. "Show me how account balance fields from the current FDX standard are transformed before being exposed in our API responses."
3. "Identify any inconsistencies in how we currently transform similar account data fields across different API calls."
4. "What percentage of our current transformations modify sensitive customer information from the FDX source data?"

### Current Provenance Analysis

5. "For account ID [X], compare the actual field transformations against our current documented transformation rules - are there discrepancies?"
6. "What's the most common deviation between our current documented transformation rules and what's actually happening in production?"
7. "Identify any gaps in our current provenance tracking where we're missing transformation details for critical FDX fields."
8. "Generate a report of all transformations performed in the last month that weren't in our current documented rules."

### Temporal Quality Evolution

9. "Show me any fields that were properly transformed in earlier versions but now have issues."
10. "How has the complexity of our field transformations evolved as we've updated our API versions?"

## Data Governance Executive

### Current Lineage Documentation Review

11. "Compare our current documented field mappings against the current FDX API standard - are there fields we're not handling?"
12. "Are all our sensitive FDX data fields being transformed according to our current documented security policies?"
13. "Identify any transformations currently applied to PII fields that aren't explicitly approved in our current documentation."
14. "Which servers are currently performing transformations that don't align with our documented processes?"

### Current Governance and Compliance

15. "Are there any FDX data fields that don't have properly documented transformation rules in our current documentation?"
16. "How do our current field transformations compare against our current documented data governance policies?"
17. "Which PII field transformations from the FDX source data might need review for compliance with our data protection policies?"
18. "Generate a complete audit trail for account ID [X], showing the most recent API call and all resulting transformations."

### Temporal Compliance Evolution

19. "How did our PII field masking policies evolve from version 1.0 to the current version, and what drove these changes?"
20. "When did we implement enhanced security measures for customer data transformations, and what specific changes were made?"
21. "Show me all the compliance-related transformations we've added across our API versions over time."
22. "Compare our current FDX 5.0 field mappings with our original mappings and highlight improved security measures."

## Data Architect

### Current Architecture Analysis

23. "Show me the current transformation path for how customer account balance data flows from FDX format to our API response format."
24. "What specific transformations are currently applied to normalize FDX owner information before API exposure?"
25. "Identify potential performance bottlenecks in our current FDX data transformation process."
26. "How do our current field mappings from FDX data align with our current API contract specifications?"
27. "Trace how customer address information is currently transformed from the FDX format to our API response format."

### Current Optimization Opportunities

28. "Based on our recent provenance records, should we revise our current transformation rules to better align with actual usage patterns?"

### Temporal Architecture Evolution

29. "How has our transformation architecture evolved from version 1.0 to the current version 3.0?"
30. "What were the key performance improvements we implemented in version 2.1, and how did they affect processing times?"
31. "Show me the evolution of our currency conversion transformations from initial implementation to current state."
32. "Which architectural changes had the most significant positive impact on transformation reliability over time?"

## Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)

### Current Customer Behavior and Patterns

33. "Which FDX data fields are most frequently accessed by our customers currently, and how might this inform our product marketing strategy?"
34. "Can we identify patterns in how our financial institution customers are currently using transformed FDX data that might indicate new use cases?"

### Product Usage Metrics

35. "Which types of financial institutions are most actively consuming our transformed FDX data, based on recent API call frequency and patterns?"
36. "Are there seasonal or cyclical patterns in how our transformed FDX data is being consumed that should inform our upcoming marketing calendar?"

### Current Competitive Differentiation

37. "How do our current FDX data transformations compare to industry standards, and what does this tell us about our data quality or uniqueness?"
38. "Which specific transformations we currently apply to FDX data appear to add the most value to our customers, based on recent usage patterns?"

### Current Customer Success Stories

39. "Identify customers who are making particularly effective use of our current transformed FDX data - they could be potential case studies."
40. "What unique ways are innovative customers currently using our transformed FDX data that we could highlight in marketing materials?"

### Temporal Adoption Patterns

41. "How did customer utilization patterns change after we implemented enhanced security transformations in version 2.0?"
42. "Which new transformations we introduced over time have seen the highest customer adoption rates?"
43. "Show me how different customer segments responded to the new owner information transformations we added in version 2.1."
44. "Which customer segments were quickest to adopt our FDX 5.0 compliant transformations, and how did their usage patterns change?"
