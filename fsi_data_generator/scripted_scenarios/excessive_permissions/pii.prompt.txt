In this analysis the objective is to identify individuals who have incompatible access to sensitive data (PII).
Only analyze PII. Do NOT analyze SoD.


Step 1: Define sensitive information categories & application associations

Task:
  - Find each application which is in PRODUCTION or DEPRECATED
  - Using AI, consider the application name and description and determine if it has access one or more of CUSTOMER PII, VENDOR PII or ASSOCIATE PII

Output:
  - Provide a table artifact of the applications, filtering to just applications that have sensitive data, including:
    * name
    * id
    * list of associated department names
    * list of associated sensitive categories
    * your reasoning

Step 2: Classify departmental access to sensitive data

Task:
  - Group applications by department, union their application's sensitive categories, and create a list of departmental sensitive categories

Output:
  - Provide a detailed list showing department name, list of applications by name, and list of sensitive categories and present as a table artifact.


Step 3: Classify roles and users by access to sensitive data

Task:
  - For each ACTIVE associate with ACTIVE roles, determine their network identities -> roles -> entitlements -> entitlement resources -> resource definitions
  - Include ALL resource definition types including, but not limited to, both APPLICATION and DATA
  - Map the resource definition's application id, to the applications in Step 1. Filter out resource definition's that don't have a match.
  - Each remaining associate has access to the sensitive data that was matched to Step 1.
  - Filter out associates with no role identified in this analysis.

Output:
  - A list of associates, including their first and last name, their associate id, a list of ACTIVE roles (by name) they are assigned to, and a list of sensitive data categories they may have access to.

Step 4: Determine inappropriate sensitive data access by department affiliation

Task:
  - For each associate identified in Step 3, find the associates department and compare the departments sensitive data categories (from Step 2) to the associates sensitive data categories (from Step 3).
  - For each associate create a list of the sensitive data category that the associate has, which the department does not have. These represent inappropriate PII access.
  - Filter out associates that have no inappropriate PII access

Output:
  - A table artifact for each associate and each associate's inappropriate PII access
       * the associate first and last name,
       * the suspicious sensitive data category,
       * a list of roles (by role name) providing the suspicious sensitive data
       * your reasons as to why the associate's responsibilities are not compatible with access to the sensitive data
