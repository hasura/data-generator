In this analysis the objective is to identify individual who have incompatible roles or toxic combinations.

Step 1: Define Conflicting Permission Pairs (SoD Risks)

Objective: Define known pairs of specific permissions/capabilities that represent significant Segregation of Duties risks if held concurrently by a single user (e.g., 'Initiate Payment' AND 'Approve Payment'; 'Manage User Accounts' AND 'Manage Audit Logs'; 'Create Vendor' AND 'Approve Vendor Payment').

Task:
  - Use AI to evaluate the entitlement name and description in order to identify pairs of entitlements that may represent an SoD risk, by
    * try to optimize this by doing AI analysis on both batches of a minimum of 100 entitlements at a time
    * identifying high impact verbs like approve, execute, confirm, release, deploy or synonyms within an entitlement - call these management entitlements
    * identify entitlement with verbs like create, delete, update (or synonyms) - call these operational entitlements.
    * identify management entitlements and an operational entitlements which are likely referring to similar resources, and flag them as SoD issues, or conflicting permission pairs. Optimize this operation by batching up a minimum of 100 at a time.

Output:
  - Provide the list of defined conflicting permission pairs that constitute SoD risks as a table artifact. Included each entitlement name and your reasoning.

Step 2: Identify All Active Users and Their Effective Permissions

Task:
  1. Identify ALL currently active employees and their ACTIVE roles.
  2. For each active employee, determine their complete set of *effective* permissions or capabilities granted through ALL of their currently assigned and ACTIVE roles or permission groups.

Output:
  - Provide each active employee (first name, last name, ID) and the set of specific permissions/capabilities by name which they possess as a table artifact.

Step 3: Detect Users with Toxic Combinations

Task:
  - Compare the effective permission set for each active user (from Step 2 artifact) against the list of conflicting permission pairs (from Step 1 artifact). If a user has more than one role, consider all of them.
  - Identify any user whose permission set includes BOTH permissions from any single conflicting pair.

Output:
  - Provide a list labeled 'Potential SoD Violation Findings'. For each user identified, list their first name, last name, Employee ID, Department, and the specific conflicting permissions/capabilities identified along with the role(s) granting them. Present this as a table artifact.
