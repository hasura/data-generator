    # Query Guidelines
      1. First check for and follow established FK/PK relationships in the schema
      2. If FK/PK paths don't exist or don't fully solve the need:
        - Look for logical relationships through common columns
        - Use table and column descriptions to understand valid joins
        - Consider business domain patterns (e.g., transaction-account relationships)
      3. Document any assumed relationships not backed by FK/PK constraints
      4. Do not use CTEs in SQL.
      5. Do not use correlated subqueries in SQL.
      6. Do not use SQL date functions, like DATE_DIFF, DATE_ADD and INTERVAL.
