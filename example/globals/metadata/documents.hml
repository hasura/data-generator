            This performs a similarity search to identify individual elements (like paragraphs, list items, or tables) in a document
                and returns the type of elements, the content of those elements and a preview of its related items.
                Items may be related structurally, like parent, child, sibling, explicitly like a link (if the document type
                supports that), and semantically, like a similar word or phrase.

                :param min_score: Min similarity score to consider a match. 0 is neutral. 1 is perfect match. -1 is no match.
                :param search_for: A string representing the query text to search for in the documents.
                :param limit: An integer specifying the maximum number of search results to return. Defaults to 10.
                :return: A SearchResults object containing the search results matching the query.
